# Pygame Assets

PygameAssets is a lightweight asset manager for Pygame applications and games.


- Define where your assets are located in the project structure.
- Load assets using the built-in asset loaders.

## Installation

Pygame Assets is available on PyPI, so use `pip` to install it:

```bash
$ pip install pygame-assets
```

## Usage

### Using the default configuration

PygameAssets has sensible defaults for loading your assets.

By default, assets are loaded from an `assets` directory that should be located at the root of your app folder.

You can then either drop your assets directly into that folder or into subfolders per type of assets. The following subfolders are supported by default:

```
images
sounds
fonts
```

### Using a custom configuration

Sometimes the default parameters are not exactly suited to your project. PygameAssets allows you to easily redefine them.
